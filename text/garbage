Let's go to china!
When I finally find turtle, I'm gonna make him a big a.. sandwich!
I wonder what the moon looked like if it were made of bolognese.
One more step and I'll be there. I'm sure of it!
I hope turtle's alright...
If x equals... no wait, if y equals... no that's not right. Y to the M to the C to the A. I got it!
Surely I should be singing stayin' alive right now!
You get a flower and you get a flower and you get a flower and you get a flower and you... eh.
Jumping from one platform to the next, ladidadidumdida.
